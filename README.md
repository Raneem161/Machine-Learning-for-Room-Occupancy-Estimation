## Overview
This project addresses the challenge of estimating room occupancy using sensor data to inform smart building management. The process involved collecting and preparing data from various environmental sensors, including addressing issues like class imbalance and multicollinearity, which can impact model performance. Several machine learning algorithms were explored, specifically Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost, with their suitability and mechanics detailed. The evaluation phase highlights the importance of using multiple performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, noting that enhancements to the dataset and model tuning, often using Grid Search with k-fold Cross-Validation, led to improved, more reliable, and balanced results for these algorithms.
